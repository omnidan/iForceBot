Adding users.

To add users, create file called <nickname>.txt and in it put any number between 1-7 (rank, see below).
NOTICE: Add only that one number, no enter nor space nor anything else. Ranks are below:

Ranks:
0:Guest
1:User
2:VIP
3:Moderator
4:Operator
5:Admin
6:Leader
7:Master

Now if you think that identifying by nick is little unsecure (it is), this is a known issue.
